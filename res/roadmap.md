# Rough Short Term Roadmap:

  * [ ] Oauth login with github, creating user records
  * [ ] Authenticate a user with session data
  * [ ]  Flesh out demo app functionality a little (unsure exactly where to go with this atm. Chat, banking, social, :shrug: )
  * [ ] Tests using more of the system (background job tests)
  * [ ] Enum tables (as opposed to check constraints)
  * [ ] Roles based authorization
  * [ ] Docker Images for deployment
  * [ ] Run format, test, lint in CI/CD (already doing github login, might as well accept github actions)
